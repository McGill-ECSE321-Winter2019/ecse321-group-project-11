# ECSE321 Project Group 1

**Project Overview**:
> There are already several co-op programs offered by McGill University, and the number of such co-op programs may increase in the future. In a co-op program, students need to take multiple semesters at companies as an integral part of their curriculum in so-called co-op terms. The scope of the software engineering group project of the Winter 2019 edition of the ECSE321 course is to develop a software system for managing co-op terms for such co-op programs.
In teams of four or five students, you will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those requirements,implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. Viewpoints developed by multiple teams will be integrated with each other via service calls.
